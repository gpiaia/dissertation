abstract = {In Agriculture industry, plants are prone to diseases caused by pathogens and environment conditions and it is a prime cause to lose of revenue. It requires continuous monitoring of plants and environment parameters to overcome this problem. A mobile Robotic system for monitoring these parameters using wireless network has been envisaged here and developed based on ARM-Linux platform. Robotic platform consists of ARM9 based S3C2440 processor from SAMSUNG and Linux Kernel , Motor driver, robot mechanical assembly. The farm environment and plant condition such as temperature, humidity soil moisture content etc. are continuously monitored through suitable data acquisition system incorporated in the robotic system. A servo motor based robotic arm is designed for collecting soil sample and test various soil parameters. A closed loop feedback algorithm based on Digital PID controller has been developed for precise position and speed control of mobile robot. The wireless control of mobile robot and monitored data acquisition is accomplished using zigbee wireless protocol. For displaying acquired data on host system a Graphical user interface is designed using qt creater framework. For independent functioning of mobile robot, application program is written in c language and cross compiled using arm-linux- gcc compiler on Ubuntu 10.04 platform and ported on the memory of ARM processor.},

abstract = {In this work, the exponential weighted square-of-error functions are exploited for controller design. It is reported that the exponential weight in square-of-error objective function is related to the maximum sensitivity of the process. Therefore, it is possible to control the maximum sensitivity of the process without measuring the frequency response. Moreover, the existing integral-square-error-and integral-time-square-error-based proportional-integral-derivative (PID) tuning rule is modified with the proposed exponential weighted square-of-error functions that allow the user to further tune the maximum sensitivity of the process. The proposed theory is corroborated with the help of a gain optimisation example by the traditional minimisation approach and a PID controller design example by the proposed tuning rule (for the stable/unstable process) and stochastic optimisation approach.},

abstract = {The inherent time-varying nonlinearity and complexity usually exist in chemical processes. The design of control structure should be properly adjusted based on the current state. In this paper, an improved conventional PID control scheme using linearization through a specified neural network is developed to control nonlinear processes. The linearization of the neural network model is used to extract the linear model for updating the controller parameters. In the scheme of the optimal tuning PID controller, the concept of general minimum variance and constrained criterias are also considered. In order to meet most of the practical application problems, several variations of the proposed method, including the momentum filter, the updating criterion and the adjustment of the step size of the control action, are presented to make the proposed algorithm more practical. To demonstrate the potential applications of the proposed strategies, two simulation problems, including a pH neutralization and a batch reactor, are applied. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We present a satellite attitude control system design using low-cost hardware and software for a 1U CubeSat. The attitude control system architecture is a crucial subsystemfor any satellite mission since precise pointing is often required to meet mission objectives. The accuracy and precision requirements are even more challenging for small satellites where limited volume, mass, and power are available for the attitude control system hardware. In this proposed embedded attitude control system design for a 1U CubeSat, pointing is obtained through a two-stage approach involving coarse and fine control modes. Fine control is achieved through the use of three reaction wheels or three magnetorquers and one reaction wheel along the pitch axis. Significant design work has been conducted to realize the proposed architecture. In this paper, we present an overview of the embedded attitude control system design; the verification results fromnumerical simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of a CubeSat-class nanosatellite; and a series of air-bearing verification tests on nanosatellite attitude control systemhardware that compares the performance of the proposed nonlinear controller with a proportional-integral-derivative controller.},

@article{Hu2001,
abstract = {—A function-based evaluation approach is proposed for a systematic study of fuzzy proportional-integral-deriva-tive (PID)-like controllers. This approach is applied for deriving process-independent design guidelines from addressing two issues: simplicity and nonlinearity. To examine the simplicity of fuzzy PID controllers, we conclude that direct-action controllers exhibit simpler design properties than gain-scheduling controllers. Then, we evaluate the inference structures of direct-action controllers in five criteria: control-action composition, input coupling, gain dependency, gain-role change, and rule/parameter growth. Three types of fuzzy PID controllers, using one-, two-and three-input inference structures, are analyzed. The results, according to the criteria, demonstrate some shortcomings in the Mamdani's two-input controllers. For keeping the simplicity feature like a linear PID controller, a one-input fuzzy PID controller with " one-to-three " mapping inference engine is recommended. We discuss three evaluation approaches in nonlinear approximation study: function-estimation-based, generalization-capability-based and nonlinearity-variation-based approximations. The present study focuses on the last approach. A nonlinearity evaluation is then performed for several one-input fuzzy PID controllers based on two measures: nonlinearity variation index (NVI) and linearity approximation index (LAI). Using these quantitative indices, one can make a reasonable selection of fuzzy reasoning mechanisms and membership functions without requiring any process infor-mation. From the study we observed that the Zadeh-Mamdani's " max-min-gravity " (MMG) scheme produces the highest score in terms of nonlinearity variations, which is superior to other schemes, such as Mizumoto's " product-sum-gravity " (PSG) and " Takagi–Sugeno–Kang " (TSK) schemes.},
